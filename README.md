# Etch-a-Sketch
Generates a random color when you mouse over any grid in the grids.
If the grid already has a color, it will darken by 10% upon mouseover. After 10 mouseovers, grid will become black.

Reset button resets the grids back to white and allows you to how many grids there should be in a row.
